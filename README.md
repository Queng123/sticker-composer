# Welcome to the CS2 sticker composer tool

You can use the tool here: https://signature-checker.pages.dev/

If you wish to contribute, please use this repo.

As a note: 
The backend is hosted on Cloudflare workers and the frontend on Cloudflare pages. 
I currently don't have a local setup but run it in preview. Will add a local setup to this readme asap. 

Thanks to [@ByMykel](https://github.com/ByMykel/CSGO-API) on whos data the stickers.json file is based on.
